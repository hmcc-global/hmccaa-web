                <p>
                  At HMCC, we believe that baptism is an important step in the
                  Christian faith as an outward expression of our inward faith.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Baptism represents a union with Jesus in his death and
                  resurrection, which is only possible through saving faith in
                  him. It is a response to the saving work of Christ and an
                  inward faith in the life of believer, but not a means of
                  salvation. Baptism allows the believer to publicly declare
                  their commitment to follow Jesus and to celebrate that with
                  their church community.
