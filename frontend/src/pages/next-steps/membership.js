              HMCC Distinctives are the specific secondary Biblical beliefs that
              HMCC holds. We know that those who join our church come from many
              different faith backgrounds and traditions, and are in an ongoing
              process of learning, discipleship, spiritual formation, and
              sanctification. We do not expect that everyone will agree on all
              of these distinctives, but we do want our members to be aware of
              them and to expect that they will be taught and implemented in our
              church.
