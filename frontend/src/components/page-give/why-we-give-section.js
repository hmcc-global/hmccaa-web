        <p>
          At HMCC, we believe that when God gives someone a vision, He will
          always provide for that vision.
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          God invites us to partner with Him in His ministry of making disciples
          and transforming the world. Our financial giving - whether it is regular
          tithes or additional gifts - is not only an expression of{" "}
          <span>thankfulness and worship unto God</span>, but also{" "}
          <span>an act of faith that God will provide and equip His church for
            His mission</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your gift propels us toward our vision and enables our church to respond
          swiftly with obedience to God's calling.{" "}
          <span>We invite you to contribute to this vision and to play a vital role
          in what God is doing!</span>
