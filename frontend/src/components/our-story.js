          Harvest Mission Community Church began in 1996 with a group
          of eight people and a dream: to be a 1st-century church in the 21st
          century. As we looked into the book of Acts, God gave us the vision to
          be a community of faith that raises bold disciples of Christ who will
          transform the world. We planted our roots on the University of
          Michigan campus in Ann Arbor with a focus of reaching college
          students, because we believe that college is a pivotal time for people
          to discover their God-given destiny. Over the years, our ministry has
          expanded to encompass people from different walks of life—from infants
          and youth, to single adults and married couples, to international
          students and families. Although the composition of our church may
          continue to change, our mission will always remain the same. We desire
          to see people’s lives transformed, redirected to Gods purposes, and
          set out to transform the world for the glory of God.
