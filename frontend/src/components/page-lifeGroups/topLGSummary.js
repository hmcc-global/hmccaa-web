            In the Bible, Jesus talks about living an abundant life. The vision
            of LIFE Group is:{" "}
            <span>
              {" "}
              to experience the fullness of life in a Biblical community where
              the Gospel is radically lived out.{" "}
            </span>
            LIFE Groups seek to accomplish this by sharing our lives with one
            another within various life stages.
          </p>

              the greater empowerment of the body of Christ.
