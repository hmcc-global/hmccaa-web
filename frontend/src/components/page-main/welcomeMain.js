          At HMCC, we believe Jesus is the most important person in the universe
          and <span>knowing Him changes everything.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          We aim to create <span>a space where you can encounter God</span> and{" "}
          <span>experience His love in the community of others</span>, whether
          meeting together on Sunday, gathering in weekly LIFE groups, serving
          the needs of our community, and much more!
        </p>
        <p>
          We hope that we can get to know you and together, understand more of
          Godâ€™s love by the way we love one another.
