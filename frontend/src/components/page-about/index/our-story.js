            Harvest Mission Community Church began in 1996 with a group of eight
            people and a dream: to be a 1st-century church in the 21st century.
            As we looked into the book of Acts, God gave us the vision{" "}
            <span>
              to be a community of faith that raises up bold disciples of Christ
              who will transform the world.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            We planted our roots on the University of Michigan campus in Ann
            Arbor with a focus of reaching college students, because we believe
            that college is a pivotal time for people to discover their
            God-given purpose. Over the years, our ministry has expanded to
            encompass people from different walks of life—from infants and
            youth, to single adults and married couples, to international
            students and families.
          </p>

            Although the composition of our church may continue to change, our
            mission will always remain the same.{" "}
            <span>
              We desire to see people’s lives transformed, redirected to Gods
              purposes, and set out to transform the world for the glory of God.
