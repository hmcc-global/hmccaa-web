          <h3>Go: Personal Mission & Team-Based Mission</h3>
          <div>
            We have been called to go out and make disciples, by sharing the
            Good News and testifying of the work God has done in our lives.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Personal Mission happens when an individual lives as the salt
                and light in our world, shares his/her faith with others and
                invites people into our community.
              </li>
              <li>
                Team-Based Mission happens when we partner together for Godâ€™s
                kingdom purposes through opportunities like missional
                initiatives, missions teams, and church plant teams.
              </li>

        <div>
          <h3>Grow: Life-on-Life & Equipping</h3>
          <div>
            We believe it is crucial that we do not grow stagnant in our faith,
            but that we are continually learning and being challenged.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Life-on-Life involves intentional relationships like Life Change
                Groups (LCG) and discipleship, which allows us to sharpen each
                other as Christ-followers.
              </li>
              <li>
                Equipping entails purposeful investment in people to live a
                transformed life through opportunities such as Experiencing
                Classes, Freedom Class, ministry team service, and learning to
                study the Bible and pray.
              </li>

        <div>
          <h3>Gather: Corporate Gatherings & Community Gatherings</h3>
          <div>
            We gather to foster a greater sense of unity and to continue to
            build up the church body.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Corporate Gatherings are what we do together as the local body
                of Christ, such as Sunday Celebration, retreats, and baptism
                services.
              </li>
              <li>
                Community Gatherings are what we do in biblical community,
                specifically LIFE Group.
