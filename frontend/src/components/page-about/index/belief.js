      "We believe that Jesus Christ is true (fully) God and true (fully) man, having been conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. He died on the cross, the complete and final sacrifice for our sins according to the Scriptures. He arose bodily from the dead, and ascended into heaven where, at God’s right hand, He intercedes for His people and rules as Lord over all.",

Then shall the eager expectation of creation be fulfilled and the whole earth shall proclaim the glory of God who makes all things new.",
