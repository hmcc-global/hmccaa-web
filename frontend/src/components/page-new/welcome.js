        <p>
          We believe <span>God created us to be in community</span> and not live
          life alone. We are glad that you're interested in connecting with us
          at HMCC, whether to learn more about God or to explore the abundant
          life He has called us to live.
        </p>
        <p>
          We gather as a church not as a religious duty but to{" "}
          <span>live out God's Word</span> by exhorting and lifting up one
          another. Furthermore, we <span>seek to encounter</span> Jesus together
          because not only does he bring healing and purpose and wholeness into
          our lives, he is glorious and worthy of our all.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you visit, we believe you will find more than just friendly
          faces, fun programs, and a celebratory atmosphere.{" "}
          <span>
            We know that lives can be transformed with just one encounter with
            Jesus.
          </span>
